 british_isles.0002.desc:0 "The [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationDescriptor', SCOPE.sC('reclaimer'))] [reclaimer.GetName] has officially announced the rebirth of a Celtic Britannia. \n\nAfter centuries of foreign rule, the Isles have returned under the control of their original owners."

 british_isles.2001.desc:0 "The time when we [embracer.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] considered France our homeland has long since passed. Our children are born here, surrounded by Saxons, and to them, Normandy will only ever be a blurred line beyond the misty shores of Britannia.\n\nAnd, as we make some of the local customs our own, so too the legacy of our culture spreads throughout the Saxon lands, giving birth to a new English identity."

 british_isles.4001.desc:0 "[founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] does not take kindly to invaders, of any kind. For centuries, we have struggled against them, fighting to reclaim our home. With great cunning and skill, I have finally succeeded in taking back the lands of ancient Dumnonia, refounding the Kingdom of [founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nThe foreign menace has been withstood, the demise of old Britannia outlasted, and I now stand ready to face whatever fresh challenges [founder.GetFaith.DevilName] may throw at us.

 british_isles.4002.desc:0 "After centuries of struggle, [founder.GetFullName] has restored the ancient kingdom of Dumnonia, called [founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] by its inhabitants, and thrown back their island's foreign invaders.\n\nThough the other lords of the British Isles are unlikely to brook this upstart power infringing on what they view as their ancestral lands, the [founder.GetPrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] people have weathered worse invasions than anything this modern age can muster. Already, they prepare to resist the inevitable grim-retaliation..."
