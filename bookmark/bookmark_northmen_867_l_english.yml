Upon hearing the news, Ragnarr's sons set sail for England to avenge their father.\n\nThe brothers have since established a firm foothold in York and The Isles. The Anglo-Saxon kings have lost battle after battle — their future looks bleak indeed.\n\nBut all hope is not lost, and a great hero could still turn the tide of history.\n\n#bold Will you lay all of England under Norse rule, or vanquish the Great Heathen Army from Anglo-Saxon soil?#!"
